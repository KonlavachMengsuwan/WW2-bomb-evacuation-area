```
https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany.html
```

### Step 2: Google Map basemap in QGIS 
```
XYZ Tiles -> Google Map
```

### Step 3: Create a point vector
```
Layer -> Create Layer -> New Shapefile Layer  

File name:          click ... to select proper source (Must) 
File encoding:      UTF-8
Geometry type:      Point
CRS:                EPSG:32635 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 35N (This CRS helps to create buffer in meter unit)
